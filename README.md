# CliTrivia

The best Command Line Trivia app on the internet!  A quick one player game of Trivia pitting each user against the best of the Open Trivia Database.  

CLI Trivia makes use of 'HTTParty' to retrieve category and question JSON data from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php).  Upon initialize, CLI Trivia generates a token to prevent duplicate questions from appearing, and creates a Category class Object for each trivia category.  The user is then offered the choice between 10 questions: either randomly selected from a specific category.  CLI Trivia then displays the questions text, answer choices, and requests user input as to which answer they wish to select.  User score is calculated and displayed.  

IF the user selects 'random', CLI Trivia randomly generates 10 questions and creates Question class Objects.  If the user selects 'category' the user is presented with a list of possible trivia categories.  Upon selected, CLI Trivia makes an API call to retrieve 10 questions based on the user selected Category ID.  

Once all 10 questions are answered, the User is presented with a summary screen and the chance to exit or begin again.
